                <p>Fortbridge’s core mission is to preserve, protect and return capital contributions through market cycles. Multifamily investment is a low risk with moderate return with added the advantage of the today’s imbalance between the strong and growing demand and limited new supply of the rental apartments in suburban United States. We focus on investing in Class B garden style apartment communities in suburban Midwest and Southeast U.S. that will benefit from our value creation process through management upside and physical improvements.</p>
