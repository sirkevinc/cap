                <p>Fortbridge Capital Partners is a data-driven real estate private equity firm with a core focus on apartment communities. Weâ€™re disciplined buyers that provide our investors direct access to larger real estate investment opportunities with institutional level return expectations. While capital preservation is our paramount goal; we seek cash-flowing assets that not only provide our investors current income on their investment, but also contain significant value-add and management upside.</p>
